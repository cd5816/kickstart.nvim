# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This configuration builds on kickstart.nvim, with `init.lua` acting as the entry point that wires plugin bootstrapping and global options. Shared defaults live under `lua/kickstart/`, where `plugins/` holds upstream modules you can extend or replace. Put local adjustments in `lua/custom/plugins/`—each Lua file there returns a plugin spec consumed by Lazy—and keep long-form docs in `doc/kickstart.txt` so they surface through `:help`. `lazy-lock.json` is generated by Lazy to pin plugin revisions; update it only when intentionally changing plugin versions.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `nvim` boots the config and triggers Lazy to install or update pinned plugins.
- `:Lazy sync` installs new specs and reconciles `lazy-lock.json` with the manifest.
- `:Lazy check` verifies plugin status before opening a pull request.
- `nvim --headless "+lua require('kickstart.health').check()" +quit` runs the bundled health checks in CI-friendly mode.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Lua files use Stylua, configured in `.stylua.toml` for two-space indentation, Unix line endings, and auto single quotes. Run `stylua .` before committing; the CI workflow `.github/workflows/stylua.yml` enforces the same rules. Name plugin specs after the feature they expose (for example, `filetree.lua`, `formatting.lua`) and return tables keyed by plugin repository for readability. Prefer descriptive local function names and snake_case variables to match upstream conventions.

## Testing Guidelines
There is no automated test suite, so rely on health checks and repeatable manual flows. Validate critical paths headlessly using the command above, then open Neovim and exercise affected plugins (e.g., `:Neotree`, LSP formatting, or diagnostics). Document any new verification steps inside the relevant plugin module to aid future contributors.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
History favors short, imperative messages with optional Conventional Commit prefixes such as `fix:` or `docs:`—follow that pattern and limit the subject to ~72 characters. Group related adjustments into a single commit so reviewers can trace changes easily. Pull requests should summarize the motivation, list manual checks (`:Lazy sync`, health command, feature walkthrough), and note any config migrations. Reference open issues or discussions when applicable, and include screenshots or gifs for UI-facing updates.
